# Pick My Food

## Initial situation

Often when brainstorming with my girlfriend what to eat, we don't come to a satisfying solution. Most of the time we end up eating the same few dishes, because we are lacking inspiration. Instead of using a random food generator, I dream of a solution tailored to our needs, favorite dishes and possibilities. 

## Description

The plan is to design a questionnaire to figure out, what food we are craving at that moment. Are we looking for a healthy meal, or is it our cheat day, where we just want to enjoy ourselves. Questions will be:

-	How much time do you have to cook?
-	How many calories do you want to intake at maximum?
-	How healthy do you want to eat?
-	How Heartwarming do you want to eat?

After answering these questions, the App will decide what food we will be making, will tell us what we need to buy and how many calories we will eat. If we are unsatisfied with the choice, the app will provide an alternative.


## Goals

In the end, we have an app that solves our most asked question: What do you want to eat tonight?

## Process and steps

1. create a list with all the food we love and transform it into a .JSON list
2. write the HTML to display the questions and answers
3. style the HTML with Bootstrap CSS
4. write the JavaScript Code to figure out what we should eat
5. Launch the app


## Risks, opportunities and measures

### Risks

- having problems figuring out the JavaScript code to transform the questions into returning answers

### Opportunities

- great app for personal use
- expand the app to other people
- allow people to add their own favorite food and decide out of those

### Measures

- not needed in the first place
